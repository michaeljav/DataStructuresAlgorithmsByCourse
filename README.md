Udemy Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms


##### 1. Big O 

**Official term:** Asymptotic Analysis:
It can tell us how well a problem is solved.
##### What is good or clean code?
1. **Readable**: can others understand.
1. **Scalable**: Big O notation is what allows us to measure this idea of scalable code that can scale.
> -->Speed  And  ---> Memory
> -->Readable (maintainable),Memory(Space Complexity)  ,Speed(Time Complexity)

**Space Complexity:** Additional space so we don't include space taken up by the inputs.



**When a program  executes,** it has two ways to remembers things, the heap and the stack.
**The heap** is usually where we store variables that we assign values to, and the stack is usually where we keep track of our function calls.

* A runtime  is simply how long  something takes to run.

* That's what scalability means as things grow larger
 and larger
##### BIG O NOTATIONS
1. **O(n)** Linear time O(10),time O(1000) 
1. **O(1)** Constant time
##### 4 Rule Book
1. Worst Case
1. Remove Constants
1. Different terms for inputs -->
O(Arrayinput + ArrayInput2)
1. Drop Non Dominants


**Note: Different terms for inputs**
> **An easy rule of thumb is any step that happens in the same indentation. So one after another, you add. 
![](Same%20indentations.png)
And anything that happens with indentation that is nested. You multiply, so, again, different inputs should have different variables.

O(n^2)


##### HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS
Company looking for:
